# Notes

This is some stuff I learnt or figured out whilst making the app.

## Playback of music from the media library
You can query the media library for songs as `[MPMediaItem]`, and you can get the assetURL property of an `MPMediaItem`. 
This looks something like `ipod-library://item/item.m4a?id=1584388628414106172`

this is incomplete
