## A modern recreation of the iPod app from iOS 4

> This project is currently under heavy work and is not fully functional. You can still test builds from GitHub Actions. 

## Backstory

I hate the official Music app a lot because it sucks, it has a ton of Apple Music ads (annoying when you sync music from your Mac) and is kinda boring.

## The Goal

I'm making this to bring nostalgia and make it a little more fun to listen to music, also I need an app with EQ. 

## Contributing

i have no clue what to put here, so dont copy my code formatting its ass
